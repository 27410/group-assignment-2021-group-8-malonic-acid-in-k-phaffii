    "Borodina et al. describe 4 different pathways to get to 3-hydroxy propionic acid with *Komatogaella phaffii*, where most of them go through malonic semialdehyde (Borodina 2014). This metabolite can serve as a precursor for both, malonic acid and 3-hydroxy propionic acid and therfore these pathways serve as a starting point for this cell factory project. The reactions, enzyms and corresponding metabolites were explored using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes KEGG (Kanehisa 2000, Kanehisa 2019, Kanehisa 2021). The described routes and the included are:\n",

Afterwards the same enzym as in the beta-alanine pathway is used to produce malonic acid. In order to force the model to work through this pathway, the enzym beta-alanine-oxoglutarate aminotransferase has to be shut down, which is described in the beta-alanine pathway as well.
