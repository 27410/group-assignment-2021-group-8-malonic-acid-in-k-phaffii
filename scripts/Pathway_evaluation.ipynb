    "### Discussion\n",
    "The graph shows the relation of the carbon yield of malonic acid per substrate (Cmol MA / Cmol MeOH) as a function of the biomass growth rate. The provided table furthermore gives the maximum values for all pathways as well as the maximum productivity. Those values are only theoretical possible, because they are optimized for zero growth rate, which would lead to a dying organism colony.  \n",
    "The results show, that first of all the maximum yield of malonic acid is the highest for the beta-alanine and malonyl-CoA Transerase pathway. Also the phenotypic phase plane shows a better behaviour in the curvature. For the first two pathways, a smaller reduction over the increasing biomass growth rate is visible, before having a crack in the curvture and going down to the maximum growth rate with no malonic acid production.  \n",
    "The results show that the first two pathways are preferable for malonic acid production and are further examined for strain improvements."

Since the supply with oxygen is often a limiting factor in fermentations, the information of optimal O2 uptake for the different objectives, growth and malonic acid production, is of great value."

    "### Discussion\n",
    "The results for the two pathways for the oxygen dependency are equal. Both the malonic acid production and the biomass growth rate seem to have the same oxygen dependency for both pathways.  \n",
    "Interestingly the oxygen demand varys between the two objectives malonic acid producation and biomass growth. The optimal uptake is slightly higher for the biomass growth. Also a difference in the curvature is visible. Furthermore a constrained simulation has been conducted where the growth was set to 50% of the maximum growth on 6 mmol/gDW\\*h methanol and no oxygen limitation. Under this boundary conditions, malonic acid is only produced after an O2 uptake rate of >~ 3 mmol/gDW\\*h and reaches less production, because of the parallel growth. The peak of maximum production is shifted and a slight difference between the two pathways is noted.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "It can be seen that the malonic acid and the biomass are having influence on the optimum and the optimal uptake rate has to be determined for a previoulsy fixed or targeted biomass growth rate."

    "### Discussion\n",
    "The results show that also here both pathways have the same dynamics for both objectives, malonic acid producation and biomass growth. It is noted, theat the maximum flux of malonic acid production is at a higher uptake rate than biomass growth. The graphs compare both fluxes, but the growth rate was multiplied with a factor of 20 to put the fluxes in the same range as the ones of the malonic acid growth. This means that the differences are much smaller than they look for the growth rate. It can be seen, that the malonic acid flux is about a third of the methanol uptake rate until the maximum is reached. This is the same relation as for the amount of carbon atoms between the two molecules.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "It is interesting to see that a carbon source repression seems to happen after the maximum is reached. The exact reason for this phenomena is not clear, since no other substrate is limiting the production. The repressions seems to be stronger for the growth rate than for the malonic acid production. Furthermore, the production and growth rate doesnt level off, but decrease back to zero eventually, which would mean that the cells die at to high methanol uptake fluxes.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Furthermore it has to be noted, that the physically possible upatake rates are at very small values. CITATION found an uptake rate of 6 mmol/gDW\\*h, which was also used for most of the evaluations. Therefore the repression through methanol is outside of a reachable uptake rate and poses no concern for the derived phenotypes. But the evaluation shows, that a linear increase of production can be achieved through an upregulation of the methanol uptake capabilities."

    "As seen in the results, the medium only needs a few components to ensure the growth and production. In general the substrate is the limitation in both cases. Further it has to be noticed, that the demands to the medium are much lower for the malonic acid production, which theoretically only needs the carbon source and oxygen to work.  \n",
    "Nevertheless, it has to be noted, that several compounds are deemed as unnecessary which has to be seen critical. First and foremost the complex additive Biotin doesnt seem to effect the growth or malic acid production in any way, while it is known to be vital to yeast organisms."
