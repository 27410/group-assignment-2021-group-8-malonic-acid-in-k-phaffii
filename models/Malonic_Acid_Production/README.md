This folder contains several files that evaluate our model organism K.phaffii. Some of them are just playgrounds for code snippets and dont represent any valuable results.
The 3 files prepared for the report that I created are:

- **create_pathway**

This is a file where all the pathways we ar evaluating are created and a function is introduced, that makes it easy to import the wanted pathways into the other scripts. A explanation is included and you are welcome to read and review this file.
- **Pathway_evaluation**

Here the pathways are compared against each other and the results are discussed. It also contains the evaluation for oxygen uptake and minimal media. Results are sometimes split for the biomass growth and malonic acid production. The file is pretty much finsihed.
- **Substrate_alternatives**

This file tries to compare all possible carbon substrates and evaluate them for malonic acid producaiton as well as biomass growth rate. I tried to put our decision to go with methanol in to perspective and discuss alternatives. Some code is pretty long and a little complicated because im doing a lot of simulations. The discussion is still unfinished and there are some dead snippets with no use at the end of the document. You can review it but it's a mess, not gonna lie. Work in progress.
