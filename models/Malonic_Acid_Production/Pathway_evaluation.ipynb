    "The reslts show, that first of all the maximum yield of malonic acid is the highest for the beta-alanine and malonyl-CoA Transerase pathway. Also the phenotypic phase plane shows a better behaviour in the curvature. For teh first two pathways, a smaller reduction over the increasing biomass growth rate is visible, before having a crack in the curvture and going down to the maximum growth rate with no malonic acid production.  \n",
    "The results show that the first two pathways are preferable for malonic acid production and ar further examined for strain improvements"

    "As seen in the results, the medium only needs a few components to ensure the growth and production. In general the substrate is the limitation in both cases. Further it has to be noticed, that the demands to the medium are much lower for the malonic acid production, which jut needs a c-source and oxygen to work.  \n",
    "Nevertheless, it has to be noted, that several compounds are deemed as unnecessary which has to be seen critical. First and for most the compley additive Biotin doesnt seem to effect the growth or malic acid production in any way, while it is known to be vital to yeast organisms."
