# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 8 - _Komagataella pfaffii_ producing malonic acid

## Project summary (<300 words)
This project aims to improve the genome-scale model (GSM) of _Komagataella phaffii_ for the production of malonic acid from methanol. GSMs created from [KBase]( https://www.kbase.us/) and [CarveMe](https://carveme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) were not used, since they either only consisted of three compartments (CarveMe) or had a bad mass balance score of 62.8% (KBase) according to [MEMOTE](https://memote.io/). Looking at the literature we found the GSM iMT1026.V3 generated by TomÃ s-Gamisans et al in 2017, which was improved for better predictions of growth in methanol. Four different pathways to improve the production of malonic acid have been added to the GSM successfully and have been analysed.
-	beta alanine pathway
-	transferase malonyl-CoA pathway
-	oxidoreductive malonyl-CoA pathway
-	lactate pathway

Out of these only the beta alanine pathway and the transferase malonyl-CoA pathway showed promising improvements of the yield.


## Project overview
The main page of the repository contains the Report.ipynb notebook, which contains the main information about this project. The GSMs used and analysed during the project are in the "src" folder and divided into GSMs we generated ourselves (gen) and the ones found in literature (lit). The MEMOTE reports created for the analysis are collected in the folder "reports". All python scripts and functions used during the development of our strategy can be found in the folder "scripts". In requirements.txt, all of the packages applied in this project are listed.
