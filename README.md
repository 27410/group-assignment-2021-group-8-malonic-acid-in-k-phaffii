# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 8 - _Komagataella pfaffii_ producing malonic acid

## Project summary (<300 words)
This project aims to improve the genome-scale model (GSM) of _Komagataella phaffii_ for the production of malonic acid from methanol. GSMs created from [KBase]( https://www.kbase.us/) and [CarveMe](https://carveme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) were not used, since they either only consisted of three compartments ([CarveMe](https://carveme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)) or had a bad mass balance score of 62.8% according to [MEMOTE](https://memote.io/). Looking at the literature we found the GSM iMT1026.V3 generated by TomÃ s-Gamisans et al in 2017, which was improved for better predictions of growth in methanol. The heterologous pathway to produce malonic acid was added successfully to this GSM. Furthermore, the model is used to calculate the maximum yield and calculating phenotypic phase planes.
