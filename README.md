# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 8 - _Komagataella pfaffii_ producing malonic acid

## Project summary (<300 words)
This project aims to improve the genome-scale model (GSM) of _Komagataella phaffii_ for the production of malonic acid from methanol. GSMs created from [KBase]( https://www.kbase.us/) and [CarveMe](https://carveme.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html) were not used, since they either only consisted of three compartments (CarveMe) or had a bad mass balance score of 62.8% (KBase) according to [MEMOTE](https://memote.io/). Looking at the literature we found the GSM iMT1026.V3 generated by Tomàs-Gamisans et al in 2017, which was improved for better predictions of growth in methanol. Four different pathways to improve the production of malonic acid have been added to the GSM successfully and have been analysed.
-	beta alanine pathway
-	transferase malonyl-CoA pathway
-	oxidoreductive malonyl-CoA pathway
-	lactate pathway

After the calculation of the phenotypic phase planes, the oxidoreductive malonyl-CoA pathway and the lactate pathway were not further analysed since they had a worse slope than the other pathways. The remaining pathways have been analysed for their maximum O2 uptake, medium optimization, alternate carbon sources and optimizing the use of precursors by implementing OptSwap, OptKnock, OptGene and OptCouple algorithms.

From the analysis it was shown that it should be possible to efficiently synthesise Malonic acid in *K. phaffii* using methanol as the substrate. The pathway of interest is through beta-alanine which was shown to be the most optimal of the ones experimented with. The production of malonic acid is possible using methanol as a substrate, but reaction has a severe impact on the growth of *K. Phaffii*. We concluded, that the most promising strategy for our cell factory is to use an inducible system, allowing the strain to accumulate biomass before switching to malonic acid production.



## Project overview
The main page of the repository contains the Report.ipynb notebook, which contains the main information about this project. The GSMs used and analysed during the project are in the "src" folder and divided into GSMs we generated ourselves (gen) and the ones found in literature (lit). The MEMOTE reports created for the analysis are collected in the folder "reports". All python scripts and functions used during the development of our strategy can be found in the folder "scripts". In requirements.txt, all of the packages applied in this project are listed.
